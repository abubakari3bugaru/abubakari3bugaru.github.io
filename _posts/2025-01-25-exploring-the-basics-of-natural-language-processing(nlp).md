# Exploring the Basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. NLP has gained immense popularity in recent years, with applications ranging from chatbots to sentiment analysis and text classification.

## Key Concepts in NLP

1. **Tokenization**: The process of splitting text into smaller units like words or sentences.
2. **Stopword Removal**: Removing common words like "the," "is," etc., that don’t add much value to the analysis.
3. **Stemming and Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their root form, for example, “running” becomes “run.”

In my recent project, I worked on a sentiment analysis task, where I scraped user comments from social media platforms and analyzed the sentiment to gain insights into customer opinions.
