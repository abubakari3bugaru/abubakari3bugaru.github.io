# Real Estate Data Collection with Web Scraping

![Project Image](/assets/images/real-estate-scraping.jpg)

This project involved scraping real estate listings from a popular website to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis. I used BeautifulSoup and Requests to extract property details such as price, location, size, and amenities.

### Project Overview

The goal was to collect up-to-date real estate data to analyze trends in property prices and locations. The data collected was later used to predict housing price trends and to develop a recommendation system.

### Key Features:
- **Web Scraping**: Extracted property listings, including price, location, and features, using BeautifulSoup.
- **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessed and cleaned the scraped data for analysis.
- **Data Export**: Saved the scraped data into CSV format for further analysis.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python** (with BeautifulSoup, Requests)
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for the web scraping process

### Results and Impact:
- Collected thousands of real estate listings, which were analyzed to predict trends in the housing market.
- Provided valuable insights into price fluctuations and market demand.
