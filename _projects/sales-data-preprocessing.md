# Sales Data Preprocessing

![Project Image](/assets/images/sales-data-cleaning.jpg)

In this project, I worked with a raw sales dataset containing numerous inconsistencies such as missing values, duplicates, and outliers. The goal was to clean and preprocess the data for downstream analytics and machine learning applications.

### Project Overview

The dataset included transaction data, product details, and customer information. Through various cleaning techniques, I ensured that the dataset was structured and ready for analysis.

### Key Features:
- **Missing Value Handling**: Imputed missing values using mean, median, and mode imputation methods.
- **Outlier Detection**: Used Z-score and IQR methods to identify and remove outliers.
- **Normalization**: Scaled numeric columns to standardize the range of values.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python** (with Pandas, NumPy)
- **Matplotlib** for visualization
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for cleaning process

### Results and Impact:
- Cleaned data that led to improved quality for predictive analysis, providing insights into sales trends.
- Ensured the dataset was free of errors, ready for future machine learning modeling.
