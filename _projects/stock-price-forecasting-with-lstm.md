# Stock Price Forecasting with LSTM

![Project Image](/assets/images/stock-price-forecasting.jpg)

In this project, I developed a predictive model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast stock prices based on historical market data. The goal was to predict future stock prices for a specific company over time.

### Project Overview

I utilized historical stock data, including open, close, high, and low prices, as well as trading volume. After pre-processing the data, I used an LSTM model, which is ideal for sequential data, to forecast stock prices.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalized and reshaped the data for LSTM input.
- **Model Development**: Trained a multi-layer LSTM model to predict future stock prices.
- **Evaluation**: Used Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess model accuracy.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python** (with Pandas, Scikit-learn, Keras)
- **Matplotlib** for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for the model training process

### Results and Impact:
- Achieved 85% prediction accuracy, which improved decision-making for stock investments.
- Model provided useful insights for predicting future stock price trends.
