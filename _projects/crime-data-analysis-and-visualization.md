# Crime Data Analysis & Visualization

![Project Image](/assets/images/crime-data-analysis.jpg)

This project involved analyzing and visualizing crime data for a major city. The goal was to uncover trends and patterns in crime occurrences, helping local authorities with resource allocation and crime prevention strategies.

### Project Overview

The dataset included information about crime incidents, including crime type, time of day, and location. Through various visualizations, I identified key insights into the distribution and trends of criminal activities.

### Key Features:
- **Data Exploration**: Cleaned and explored the dataset to understand the frequency of different crime types.
- **Geospatial Visualization**: Mapped crime locations to identify high-crime areas.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Analyzed crime occurrences over different times of the day and days of the week.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python** (with Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for exploration and analysis
- **Geopandas** for geospatial data analysis

### Results and Impact:
- Visualized hotspots of criminal activity, aiding in decision-making for law enforcement deployment.
- Identified peak crime periods, helping to optimize patrol schedules.
