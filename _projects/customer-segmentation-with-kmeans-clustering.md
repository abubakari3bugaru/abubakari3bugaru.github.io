# Customer Segmentation with KMeans Clustering

![Project Image](/assets/images/foo-bar-identity.jpg)

This project was aimed at segmenting a customer base into distinct groups for better marketing strategies. We used KMeans clustering on the dataset to identify customer segments based on various features.

### Project Overview

In this project, I worked with a large dataset of customer data, including purchasing behavior and demographics. Using the KMeans algorithm, I was able to identify **3 distinct customer segments** with common characteristics. The results were used to improve targeted marketing efforts.

### Key Features:
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Removed outliers, handled missing data, and normalized features.
- **Clustering**: Used the KMeans algorithm to create customer segments.
- **Data Visualization**: Created visualizations to understand segment characteristics.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python** (with libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- **Matplotlib** for visualization
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for analysis

### Results and Impact:

- Helped the marketing team to tailor strategies based on customer preferences.
