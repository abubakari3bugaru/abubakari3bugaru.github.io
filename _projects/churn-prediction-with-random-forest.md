# Churn Prediction with Random Forest

![Project Image](/assets/images/churn-prediction.jpg)

In this project, I built a churn prediction model using customer data to identify users at risk of leaving a subscription service. By predicting churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.

### Project Overview

The dataset contained customer information, including subscription details, usage patterns, and demographic data. I used the Random Forest classifier to predict whether a customer would churn or remain with the service.

### Key Features:
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features based on customer behavior and demographics.
- **Model Building**: Used Random Forest, a powerful ensemble learning algorithm, for churn prediction.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python** (with Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for model training and evaluation

### Results and Impact:
- Achieved 90% prediction accuracy, enabling businesses to predict customer churn and take timely retention actions.
- Enhanced customer retention by helping the marketing team identify high-risk users.
