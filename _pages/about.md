# About Me

Hello! I'm **Abubakari Ramadhani Bugaru**, a passionate **Data Scientist** and **IT Professional** based in **Dar es Salaam, Tanzania**. I hold a **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** from the **University of Dar es Salaam**, and I'm deeply interested in leveraging data science and analytics, machine learning, and AI to solve complex real-world problems.

### My Journey into Data Science
I’ve always had a strong inclination toward technology and data. After completing my studies in Computer Science, I pursued professional certifications in **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Responsible AI** from **AI4DLab Tanzania** and participated in the **Digital Job Program** with **Digital Opportunity Trust Tanzania**. My experience spans across several industries, from **healthcare data management** at **Tanzania Data Lab** to **web development** and **IT management** at **Luziro Media Ltd**.

In my current role as **IT Manager**, I focus on managing IT infrastructure, developing company websites, and ensuring data security. My prior work in data entry, web scraping, and telecom engineering has also strengthened my technical skill set, giving me a broad perspective on data science, IT, and systems development.

I've worked on a variety of projects, ranging from data cleaning and visualization to building predictive models using machine learning algorithms. I’m continuously learning and growing, keeping up with new tools and techniques in the industry.

### Why Data Science?
Data science is more than just analyzing numbers to me. It’s about uncovering hidden insights and driving decisions with data. I’m excited about **machine learning**, **natural language processing**, and **data visualization**, and I constantly strive to learn and grow in these areas.

I love that data science allows me to take raw data, clean and analyze it, and ultimately extract insights that can drive business decisions or improve systems. It's like solving a mystery — using data to find patterns and answers!

### Interests:
- **Big Data and Data Engineering**
- **Predictive Analytics**
- **Predictive Modeling & Statistical Analysis**
- **Data Visualization**
- **Machine Learning & AI**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

I’m currently exploring opportunities where I can apply my skills in **data analysis**, **predictive modeling**, and **machine learning** to real-world challenges. If you have a project or an opportunity in mind, let's connect and make an impact!
